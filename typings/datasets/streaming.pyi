    We patch some functions in the module to use `fsspec` to support data streaming:
    - We use `fsspec.open` to open and read remote files. We patch the module function:
      - `open`
    - We use the "::" hop separator to join paths and navigate remote compressed/archive files. We patch the module
      functions:
      - `os.path.join`
      - `pathlib.Path.joinpath` and `pathlib.Path.__truediv__` (called when using the "/" operator)

    The patched functions are replaced with custom functions defined to work with the
    :class:`~download.streaming_download_manager.StreamingDownloadManager`.

    Args:
        module_path: Path to the module to be extended.
        download_config: Mainly use `token` or `storage_options` to support different platforms and auth types.
