Hashing function for dataset keys using `hashlib.md5`

Requirements for the hash function:

- Provides a uniformly distributed hash from random space
- Adequately fast speed
- Working with multiple input types (in this case, `str`, `int` or `bytes`)
- Should be platform independent (generates same hash on different OS and systems)

The hashing function provides a unique 128-bit integer hash of the key provided.

The split name is being used here as the hash salt to avoid having same hashes
in different splits due to same keys
